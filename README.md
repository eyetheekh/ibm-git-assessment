# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple Bash-based calculator that computes **Simple Interest** based on user input.

## Formula Used
Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

I = P × R × T / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal Amount
- **R** = Rate of Interest
- **T** = Time Period
- **I** = Interest

## How It Works
The script asks the user to enter:
1. Principal amount
2. Rate of interest
3. Time period

It then calculates and displays the simple interest.

## Example
If:
- Principal = 1000  
- Rate = 5  
- Time = 2  

Interest = 1000 × 5 × 2 / 100 = **100**

## How to Run
```bash
bash simple-interest.sh
